Topic: **Smart Contract languages of the EVM: What else is there besides Solidity?**

Description: Solidity is the most popular smart contract language today, but is it your only choice?
What else is there?
Are you missing out on important features?
The talk walks you through the evolution of smart contract languages built on top of the EVM,
showing off their strengths and weaknesses, contrasting them with Solidity as we know it today.
From the early implementations, through esoteric experiments to the select few languages that
eventually came out on top. Which one should you use for your next project?
