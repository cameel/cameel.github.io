# Introduction

## About me

- Kamil Åšliwak
- Member of the Solidity compiler team at Ethereum Foundation.
- Co-founder of Code Poets, a software house that specializes in blockchain and cheminformatics.

## Workshop structure
- 3 segments, each about a different smart contract language:
    1. Vyper
    1. Yul
    1. Flint
- Bonus language to explore on your own: Lira
- Each segment has 3 parts:
    1. Quick introduction to the language. General picture of its syntax and features.
    1. Some theory about the EVM and the compiler.
    1. Hands-on experience with the language.
        - We'll deploy and play with some example contracts.
        - Try to follow on your own computer.
        - This is the time to ask questions.
